# ResNet_OCT_Disease

The dataset in kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018) is an OCT dataset organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (NORMAL,CNV,DME,DRUSEN). I learn a lot from this github page (https://github.com/anoopsanka/retinal_oct), and I write a naive version and upload it in here. It incorporate a reanet as a basis model and some convolution layers. 

After I learn more about self-supervised model and get better understanding I would upload a better version here.
